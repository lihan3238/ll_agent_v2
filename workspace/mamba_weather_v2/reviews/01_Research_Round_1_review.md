## 3. 相关工作综述 (Related Work)
Recent advances in state space models, particularly Mamba architectures, have demonstrated promising alternatives to Transformer-based approaches for long-sequence modeling. Papers like [5] MAT explore hybrid Mamba-Transformer architectures for time series forecasting, explicitly addressing long-short range dependencies in weather dynamics. However, these hybrid approaches lack rigorous mathematical justification for their architectural choices and fail to systematically analyze the trade-offs between computational efficiency and modeling accuracy. Concurrently, applications in computer vision ([2] Mamba YOLO, [4] Segment Anything variants) demonstrate Mamba's scalability to high-dimensional data but reveal limitations in handling rapidly changing contexts. The fundamental gap lies in the theoretical understanding of how Mamba's selective state space mechanisms interact with the inherent non-stationarity and multi-scale dependencies present in atmospheric data. While [1] provides historical context on traditional vs. machine learning approaches, it predates recent state space model innovations, leaving open questions about optimal architectural choices for weather forecasting where both long-range dependencies and computational constraints are critical.

- **A Review of ARIMA vs. Machine Learning Approaches for Time Series Forecasting in Data Driven Networks**
  - *Summary*: In the broad scientific field of time series forecasting, the ARIMA models and their variants have been widely applied for half a century now due to their mathematical simplicity and flexibility in application. However, with the recent advances in the development and efficient deployment of artificial intelligence models and techniques, the view is rapidly changing, with a shift towards machine and deep learning approaches becoming apparent, even without a complete evaluation of the superiority of the new approach over the classic statistical algorithms. Our work constitutes an extensive review of the published scientific literature regarding the comparison of ARIMA and machine learning algorithms applied to time series forecasting problems, as well as the combination of these two approaches in hybrid statistical-AI models in a wide variety of data applications (finance, health, weather, utilities, and network traffic prediction). Our review has shown that the AI algorithms display better prediction performance in most applications, with a few notable exceptions analyzed in our Discussion and Conclusions sections, while the hybrid statistical-AI models steadily outperform their individual parts, utilizing the best algorithmic features of both worlds.
- **Mamba YOLO: A Simple Baseline for Object Detection with State Space Model**
  - *Summary*: Driven by the rapid development of deep learning technology, the YOLO series has set a new benchmark for real-time object detectors. Additionally, transformer-based structures have emerged as the most powerful solution in the field, greatly extending the model's receptive field and achieving significant performance improvements. However, this improvement comes at a cost, as the quadratic complexity of the self-attentive mechanism increases the computational burden of the model. To address this problem, we introduce a simple yet effective baseline approach called Mamba YOLO. Our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose that the ODMamba backbone introduce a State Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity to address the quadratic complexity of self-attention. Unlike the other Transformer-base and SSM-base method, ODMamba is simple to train without pretraining. 2) For real-time requirement, we designed the macro structure of ODMamba, determined the optimal stage ratio and scaling size. 3) We design the RG Block that employs a multi-branch structure to model the channel dimensions, which addresses the possible limitations of SSM in sequence modeling, such as insufficient receptive fields and weak image localization. This design captures localized image dependencies more accurately and significantly. Extensive experiments on the publicly available COCO benchmark dataset show that Mamba YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to previous methods. Specifically, a tiny version of Mamba YOLO achieves a 7.5% improvement in mAP on a single 4090 GPU with an inference time of 1.5 ms.
- **Matten: Video Generation with Mamba-Attention**
  - *Summary*: In this paper, we introduce Matten, a cutting-edge latent diffusion model with Mamba-Attention architecture for video generation. With minimal computational cost, Matten employs spatial-temporal attention for local video content modeling and bidirectional Mamba for global video content modeling. Our comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that Matten has competitive performance with the current Transformer-based and GAN-based models in benchmark performance, achieving superior FVD scores and efficiency. Additionally, we observe a direct positive correlation between the complexity of our designed model and the improvement in video quality, indicating the excellent scalability of Matten.
- **Mamba or RWKV: Exploring High-Quality and High-Efficiency Segment Anything Model**
  - *Summary*: Transformer-based segmentation methods face the challenge of efficient inference when dealing with high-resolution images. Recently, several linear attention architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have attracted much attention as they can process long sequences efficiently. In this work, we focus on designing an efficient segment-anything model by exploring these different architectures. Specifically, we design a mixed backbone that contains convolution and RWKV operation, which achieves the best for both accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we design an efficient decoder to utilize the multiscale tokens to obtain high-quality masks. We denote our method as RWKV-SAM, a simple, effective, fast baseline for SAM-like models. Moreover, we build a benchmark containing various high-quality segmentation datasets and jointly train one efficient yet high-quality segmentation model using this benchmark. Based on the benchmark results, our RWKV-SAM achieves outstanding performance in efficiency and segmentation quality compared to transformers and other linear attention models. For example, compared with the same-scale transformer model, RWKV-SAM achieves more than 2x speedup and can achieve better segmentation performance on various datasets. In addition, RWKV-SAM outperforms recent vision Mamba models with better classification and semantic segmentation results. Code and models will be publicly available.
- **Integration of Mamba and Transformer - MAT for Long-Short Range Time Series Forecasting with Application to Weather Dynamics**
  - *Summary*: Long-short range time series forecasting is essential for predicting future trends and patterns over extended periods. While deep learning models such as Transformers have made significant strides in advancing time series forecasting, they often encounter difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies and effectively managing sparse semantic features. The state space model, Mamba, addresses these issues through its adept handling of selective input and parallel computing, striking a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. This article examines the advantages and disadvantages of both Mamba and Transformer models, and introduces a combined approach, MAT, which leverages the strengths of each model to capture unique long-short range dependencies and inherent evolutionary patterns in multivariate time series. Specifically, MAT harnesses the long-range dependency capabilities of Mamba and the short-range characteristics of Transformers. Experimental results on benchmark weather datasets demonstrate that MAT outperforms existing comparable methods in terms of prediction accuracy, scalability, and memory efficiency.

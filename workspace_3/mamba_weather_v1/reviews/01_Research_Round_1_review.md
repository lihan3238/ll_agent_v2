Recent advancements in time series forecasting, particularly through the use of Transformers, have highlighted their strengths in capturing complex relationships through self-attention mechanisms. However, studies such as 'Integration of Mamba and Transformer - MAT for Long-Short Range Time Series Forecasting' underscore persistent challenges in long-range dependency modeling, particularly in dynamic contexts like weather forecasting. The limitations of conventional methods such as gradient boosting, which lacks dynamic temporal learning capabilities, further motivate the need for an integrated approach that captures both temporal dynamics and contextual dependencies, making the case for the proposed Mamba-Transformer integration.

- **TimeMixer: Decomposable Multiscale Mixing for Time Series Forecasting**
  - *Summary*: Time series forecasting is widely used in extensive applications, such as traffic planning and weather forecasting. However, real-world time series usually present intricate temporal variations, making forecasting extremely challenging. Going beyond the mainstream paradigms of plain decomposition and multiperiodicity analysis, we analyze temporal variations in a novel view of multiscale-mixing, which is based on an intuitive but important observation that time series present distinct patterns in different sampling scales. The microscopic and the macroscopic information are reflected in fine and coarse scales respectively, and thereby complex variations can be inherently disentangled. Based on this observation, we propose TimeMixer as a fully MLP-based architecture with Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM) blocks to take full advantage of disentangled multiscale series in both past extraction and future prediction phases. Concretely, PDM applies the decomposition to multiscale series and further mixes the decomposed seasonal and trend components in fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine directions separately, which successively aggregates the microscopic seasonal and macroscopic trend information. FMM further ensembles multiple predictors to utilize complementary forecasting capabilities in multiscale observations. Consequently, TimeMixer is able to achieve consistent state-of-the-art performances in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with favorable run-time efficiency.
- **Transformer Versus LSTM: A Comparison of Deep Learning Models for Karst Spring Discharge Forecasting**
  - *Summary*: Karst springs are essential drinking water resources, however, modeling them poses challenges due to complex subsurface flow processes. Deep learning models can capture complex relationships due to their ability to learn non‐linear patterns. This study evaluates the performance of the Transformer in forecasting spring discharges for up to 4 days. We compare it to the Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network and a common baseline model on a well‐studied Austrian karst spring (LKAS2) with an extensive hourly database. We evaluated the models for two further karst springs with diverse discharge characteristics for comparing the performances based on four metrics. In the discharge‐based scenario, the Transformer performed significantly better than the LSTM for the spring with the longest response times (9% mean difference across metrics), while it performed poorer for the spring with the shortest response time (4% difference). Moreover, the Transformer better predicted the shape of the discharge during snowmelt. Both models performed well across all lead times and springs with 0.64–0.92 for the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and 10.8%–28.7% for the symmetric mean absolute percentage error for the LKAS2 spring. The temporal information, rainfall and electrical conductivity were the controlling input variables for the non‐discharge based scenario. The uncertainty analysis revealed that the prediction intervals are smallest in winter and autumn and highest during snowmelt. Our results thus suggest that the Transformer is a promising model to support the drinking water abstraction management, and can have advantages due to its attention mechanism particularly for longer response times.
- **Exploring transformer models for sentiment classification: A comparison of BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and XLNet**
  - *Summary*: Transfer learning models have proven superior to classical machine learning approaches in various text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, news categorization, and natural language inference. Recently, these models have shown exceptional results in natural language understanding (NLU). Advanced attention‐based language models like BERT and XLNet excel at handling complex tasks across diverse contexts. However, they encounter difficulties when applied to specific domains. Platforms like Facebook, characterized by continually evolving casual and sophisticated language, demand meticulous context analysis even from human users. The literature has proposed numerous solutions using statistical and machine learning techniques to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of online customer reviews, but most of them rely on various business, review, and reviewer features, which leads to generalizability issues. Furthermore, there have been very few studies investigating the effectiveness of state‐of‐the‐art pre‐trained language models for sentiment classification in reviews. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and XLNet in sentiment classification using the Yelp reviews dataset. The models were fine‐tuned, and the results obtained with the same hyperparameters are as follows: 98.30 for RoBERTa, 98.20 for XLNet, 97.40 for BERT, 97.20 for ALBERT, and 96.00 for DistilBERT.
- **Accurate weather forecasting with dominant gradient boosting using machine learning**
  - *Summary*: This Paper examines the interesting topic of weather forecasting using ML. From kaggle.com, there is an extensive list of daily weather records for a Seattle dataset. In this chapter, gradient boosting outcomes are revealed as a result of careful data preparation and thorough examination of several machine learning models such as K-Nearest Neighbors, Support vector machine, Gradient Boosting, XGBOOST, logistic regression, and random forest class Its 80.95% accuracy was outstanding. ML traverses atmospheric dynamics that form a basis for weather predictions. It uses a highly developed method that enables it to predict the complex trends in the weather. In addition, machine learning algorithms are increasingly important for detecting non-linear relationships and patterns from large sets of complex data with time. It is critical for meteorologists in overcoming uncertainties associated with atmospheric dynamics to improve prediction. Gradient Boosting – a weather forecasting perspective in an interdisciplinary landscape involving weather science and machine learning. The current research on ML for weather forecasting has been very useful.
- **Integration of Mamba and Transformer - MAT for Long-Short Range Time Series Forecasting with Application to Weather Dynamics**
  - *Summary*: Long-short range time series forecasting is essential for predicting future trends and patterns over extended periods. While deep learning models such as Transformers have made significant strides in advancing time series forecasting, they often encounter difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies and effectively managing sparse semantic features. The state space model, Mamba, addresses these issues through its adept handling of selective input and parallel computing, striking a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. This article examines the advantages and disadvantages of both Mamba and Transformer models, and introduces a combined approach, MAT, which leverages the strengths of each model to capture unique long-short range dependencies and inherent evolutionary patterns in multivariate time series. Specifically, MAT harnesses the long-range dependency capabilities of Mamba and the short-range characteristics of Transformers. Experimental results on benchmark weather datasets demonstrate that MAT outperforms existing comparable methods in terms of prediction accuracy, scalability, and memory efficiency.

## 5. 实施建议 (Implementation Suggestions)
To move forward with the proposed integration of Mamba and Transformer models, the following steps are recommended: 1) Conduct an ablation study to evaluate the impact of Mamba's state space representation on forecasting accuracy compared to pure Transformer models; 2) Implement a hybrid training regime that combines supervised learning on historical data with reinforcement learning to adaptively refine model parameters; 3) Test the model on multiple datasets with varying temporal characteristics to assess generalizability and robustness; 4) Explore alternative attention mechanisms or gating strategies that may further enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies.

## 3. 相关工作综述 (Related Work)
Recent works highlight the challenges faced by existing time series forecasting methods, particularly in the context of weather dynamics. For instance, the paper 'Integration of Mamba and Transformer - MAT for Long-Short Range Time Series Forecasting with Application to Weather Dynamics' discusses how long-short range forecasting techniques struggle with capturing long-term dependencies effectively, a critical requirement for accurate weather predictions. Additionally, 'TimeMixer: Decomposable Multiscale Mixing for Time Series Forecasting' suggests that while decomposition methods can improve forecasting, they may fail to account for the complex interactions present in meteorological data. These findings point to the necessity for models like Mamba that can adaptively manage temporal dependencies and structural variations in a unified framework.

### 论文摘要详情:
- **TimeMixer: Decomposable Multiscale Mixing for Time Series Forecasting**
  - *Summary*: Time series forecasting is widely used in extensive applications, such as traffic planning and weather forecasting. However, real-world time series usually present intricate temporal variations, making forecasting extremely challenging. Going beyond the mainstream paradigms of plain decomposition and multiperiodicity analysis, we analyze temporal variations in a novel view of multiscale-mixing, which is based on an intuitive but important observation that time series present distinct patterns in different sampling scales. The microscopic and the macroscopic information are reflected in fine and coarse scales respectively, and thereby complex variations can be inherently disentangled. Based on this observation, we propose TimeMixer as a fully MLP-based architecture with Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM) blocks to take full advantage of disentangled multiscale series in both past extraction and future prediction phases. Concretely, PDM applies the decomposition to multiscale series and further mixes the decomposed seasonal and trend components in fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine directions separately, which successively aggregates the microscopic seasonal and macroscopic trend information. FMM further ensembles multiple predictors to utilize complementary forecasting capabilities in multiscale observations. Consequently, TimeMixer is able to achieve consistent state-of-the-art performances in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with favorable run-time efficiency.
- **Transformer Versus LSTM: A Comparison of Deep Learning Models for Karst Spring Discharge Forecasting**
  - *Summary*: Karst springs are essential drinking water resources, however, modeling them poses challenges due to complex subsurface flow processes. Deep learning models can capture complex relationships due to their ability to learn non‐linear patterns. This study evaluates the performance of the Transformer in forecasting spring discharges for up to 4 days. We compare it to the Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network and a common baseline model on a well‐studied Austrian karst spring (LKAS2) with an extensive hourly database. We evaluated the models for two further karst springs with diverse discharge characteristics for comparing the performances based on four metrics. In the discharge‐based scenario, the Transformer performed significantly better than the LSTM for the spring with the longest response times (9% mean difference across metrics), while it performed poorer for the spring with the shortest response time (4% difference). Moreover, the Transformer better predicted the shape of the discharge during snowmelt. Both models performed well across all lead times and springs with 0.64–0.92 for the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and 10.8%–28.7% for the symmetric mean absolute percentage error for the LKAS2 spring. The temporal information, rainfall and electrical conductivity were the controlling input variables for the non‐discharge based scenario. The uncertainty analysis revealed that the prediction intervals are smallest in winter and autumn and highest during snowmelt. Our results thus suggest that the Transformer is a promising model to support the drinking water abstraction management, and can have advantages due to its attention mechanism particularly for longer response times.
- **Exploring transformer models for sentiment classification: A comparison of BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and XLNet**
  - *Summary*: Transfer learning models have proven superior to classical machine learning approaches in various text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, news categorization, and natural language inference. Recently, these models have shown exceptional results in natural language understanding (NLU). Advanced attention‐based language models like BERT and XLNet excel at handling complex tasks across diverse contexts. However, they encounter difficulties when applied to specific domains. Platforms like Facebook, characterized by continually evolving casual and sophisticated language, demand meticulous context analysis even from human users. The literature has proposed numerous solutions using statistical and machine learning techniques to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of online customer reviews, but most of them rely on various business, review, and reviewer features, which leads to generalizability issues. Furthermore, there have been very few studies investigating the effectiveness of state‐of‐the‐art pre‐trained language models for sentiment classification in reviews. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and XLNet in sentiment classification using the Yelp reviews dataset. The models were fine‐tuned, and the results obtained with the same hyperparameters are as follows: 98.30 for RoBERTa, 98.20 for XLNet, 97.40 for BERT, 97.20 for ALBERT, and 96.00 for DistilBERT.
- **Integration of Mamba and Transformer - MAT for Long-Short Range Time Series Forecasting with Application to Weather Dynamics**
  - *Summary*: Long-short range time series forecasting is essential for predicting future trends and patterns over extended periods. While deep learning models such as Transformers have made significant strides in advancing time series forecasting, they often encounter difficulties in capturing long-term dependencies and effectively managing sparse semantic features. The state space model, Mamba, addresses these issues through its adept handling of selective input and parallel computing, striking a balance between computational efficiency and prediction accuracy. This article examines the advantages and disadvantages of both Mamba and Transformer models, and introduces a combined approach, MAT, which leverages the strengths of each model to capture unique long-short range dependencies and inherent evolutionary patterns in multivariate time series. Specifically, MAT harnesses the long-range dependency capabilities of Mamba and the short-range characteristics of Transformers. Experimental results on benchmark weather datasets demonstrate that MAT outperforms existing comparable methods in terms of prediction accuracy, scalability, and memory efficiency.
- **Comparison of LSTM and Transformer for Time Series Data Forecasting**
  - *Summary*: Time series data is data that is collected periodically and has certain time intervals. Time series data is widely available in the fields of finance, meteorology, signal processing, health, and economics. Weather data, stock prices, and sales data are examples of time series data. Time series data analysis can be used to predict future conditions based on patterns and values from previous data through a forecasting process. These forecasting results are useful for identifying trends and data patterns for decision making. The rapid development of deep learning models can now be used as a method for forecasting time series data. Deep learning models that are suitable for forecasting include sequence-to-sequence models such as Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Transformer. LSTM and Transformer are sequence-to-sequence models that are widely used for forecasting time series data. Research to compare the accuracy of the two models is still very limited. This article will discuss the use of the LSTM and Transformer models for the time series data forecasting process using Hewlett Packard stock price data from 1962 to 2022. The accuracy results show that the LSTM model outperforms the Transformer model in forecasting Hewlett Packard stock prices.

## 5. 实施建议 (Implementation Suggestions)
Future work should include rigorous empirical validation of the Mamba state space model against benchmark datasets in weather dynamics. Additional steps may involve conducting ablation studies to quantify the impact of various components of the Mamba model, particularly regarding its dynamic dependency capturing capabilities. Finally, exploring hybrid architectures that integrate Mamba with other forecasting techniques could provide insights into further improving prediction accuracy.

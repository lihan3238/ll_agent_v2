Recent advancements in time series forecasting have highlighted the challenges posed by complex temporal variations and the limitations of static models. The work on TimeMixer illustrates an effort to address these complexities through decomposable multiscale mixing; however, it still operates under the assumption of stationary processes, which may not capture the dynamic nature of meteorological data. Meanwhile, the Transformer architecture, while powerful, suffers from computational inefficiencies that hinder its application in long-term forecasting. The Mamba state space model emerges as a promising solution, aiming to leverage adaptive attention mechanisms to overcome these limitations and enhance predictive accuracy in dynamic forecasting contexts.

- **Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model**
  - *Summary*: Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

- **TimeMixer: Decomposable Multiscale Mixing for Time Series Forecasting**
  - *Summary*: Time series forecasting is widely used in extensive applications, such as traffic planning and weather forecasting. However, real-world time series usually present intricate temporal variations, making forecasting extremely challenging. Going beyond the mainstream paradigms of plain decomposition and multiperiodicity analysis, we analyze temporal variations in a novel view of multiscale-mixing, which is based on an intuitive but important observation that time series present distinct patterns in different sampling scales. The microscopic and the macroscopic information are reflected in fine and coarse scales respectively, and thereby complex variations can be inherently disentangled. Based on this observation, we propose TimeMixer as a fully MLP-based architecture with Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM) blocks to take full advantage of disentangled multiscale series in both past extraction and future prediction phases. Concretely, PDM applies the decomposition to multiscale series and further mixes the decomposed seasonal and trend components in fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine directions separately, which successively aggregates the microscopic seasonal and macroscopic trend information. FMM further ensembles multiple predictors to utilize complementary forecasting capabilities in multiscale observations. Consequently, TimeMixer is able to achieve consistent state-of-the-art performances in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with favorable run-time efficiency.
- **SSAMBA: Self-Supervised Audio Representation Learning With Mamba State Space Model**
  - *Summary*: Transformers have revolutionized deep learning across various tasks, including audio representation learning, due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, they often suffer from quadratic complexity in both GPU memory usage and computational inference time, affecting their efficiency. Recently, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba have emerged as a promising alternative, offering a more efficient approach by avoiding these complexities. Given these advantages, we explore the potential of SSM-based models in audio tasks. In this paper, we introduce Self-Supervised Audio Mamba (SSAMBA), the first self-supervised, attention-free, and SSM-based model for audio representation learning. SSAMBA leverages the bidirectional Mamba to capture complex audio patterns effectively. We incorporate a self-supervised pretraining framework that optimizes both discriminative and generative objectives, enabling the model to learn robust audio representations from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. We evaluated SSAMBA on various tasks such as audio classification, keyword spotting, speaker identification, and emotion recognition. Our results demonstrate that SSAMBA outperforms the Self-Supervised Audio Spectrogram Transformer (SSAST) in most tasks. Notably, SSAMBA is approximately 92.7% faster in batch inference speed and 95.4% more memory-efficient than SSAST for the tiny model size with an input token size of 22k. These efficiency gains, combined with superior performance, underscore the effectiveness of SSAMBA’s architectural innovation, making it a compelling choice for a wide range of audio processing applications.

- **Time series forecasting model for non-stationary series pattern extraction using deep learning and GARCH modeling**
  - *Summary*: This paper presents a novel approach to time series forecasting, an area of significant importance across diverse fields such as finance, meteorology, and industrial production. Time series data, characterized by its complexity involving trends, cyclicality, and random fluctuations, necessitates sophisticated methods for accurate forecasting. Traditional forecasting methods, while valuable, often struggle with the non-linear and non-stationary nature of time series data. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative model that combines signal decomposition and deep learning techniques. Our model employs Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) for learning the volatility in time series changes, followed by Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN) for data decomposition, significantly simplifying data complexity. We then apply Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to effectively learn the features of the decomposed data. The integration of these advanced techniques enables our model to fully capture and analyze the intricate features of time series data at various interval lengths. We have evaluated our model on multiple typical time-series datasets, demonstrating its enhanced predictive accuracy and stability compared to traditional methods. This research not only contributes to the field of time series forecasting but also opens avenues for the application of hybrid models in big data analysis, particularly in understanding and predicting the evolution of complex systems.
- **Transformer Versus LSTM: A Comparison of Deep Learning Models for Karst Spring Discharge Forecasting**
  - *Summary*: Karst springs are essential drinking water resources, however, modeling them poses challenges due to complex subsurface flow processes. Deep learning models can capture complex relationships due to their ability to learn non‐linear patterns. This study evaluates the performance of the Transformer in forecasting spring discharges for up to 4 days. We compare it to the Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network and a common baseline model on a well‐studied Austrian karst spring (LKAS2) with an extensive hourly database. We evaluated the models for two further karst springs with diverse discharge characteristics for comparing the performances based on four metrics. In the discharge‐based scenario, the Transformer performed significantly better than the LSTM for the spring with the longest response times (9% mean difference across metrics), while it performed poorer for the spring with the shortest response time (4% difference). Moreover, the Transformer better predicted the shape of the discharge during snowmelt. Both models performed well across all lead times and springs with 0.64–0.92 for the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and 10.8%–28.7% for the symmetric mean absolute percentage error for the LKAS2 spring. The temporal information, rainfall and electrical conductivity were the controlling input variables for the non‐discharge based scenario. The uncertainty analysis revealed that the prediction intervals are smallest in winter and autumn and highest during snowmelt. Our results thus suggest that the Transformer is a promising model to support the drinking water abstraction management, and can have advantages due to its attention mechanism particularly for longer response times.

## 5. 实施建议 (Implementation Suggestions)

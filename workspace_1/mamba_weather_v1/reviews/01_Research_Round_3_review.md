Recent advancements in weather forecasting have leveraged deep learning techniques, particularly transformers, demonstrating competitive accuracy against traditional operational systems. However, as noted in 'Scaling transformer neural networks for skillful and reliable medium-range weather forecasting', existing transformers exhibit challenges in capturing long-range dependencies due to their fixed attention mechanisms. Furthermore, 'TimeMixer' and other decomposition-based methods have been criticized for their inability to account for the intricate interactions across multiple temporal scales, potentially leading to performance degradation. These limitations underscore the necessity for an integrated approach that combines the strengths of state-space models, like Mamba, which can more effectively model non-linear dynamics and adapt to evolving temporal patterns in weather data.

- **Learning Dynamics and Heterogeneity of Spatial-Temporal Graph Data for Traffic Forecasting**
  - *Summary*: Accurate traffic forecasting is critical in improving safety, stability, and efficiency of intelligent transportation systems. Despite years of studies, accurate traffic prediction still faces the following challenges, including modeling the dynamics of trafﬁc data along both temporal and spatial dimensions, and capturing the periodicity and the spatial heterogeneity of trafﬁc data, and the problem is more difficult for long-term forecast. In this paper, we propose an Attention based Spatial-Temporal Graph Neural Network (ASTGNN) for traffic forecasting. Specifically, in the temporal dimension, we design a novel self-attention mechanism that is capable of utilizing the local context, which is specialized for numerical sequence representation transformation. It enables our prediction model to capture the temporal dynamics of traffic data and to enjoy global receptive ﬁelds that is beneficial for long-term forecast. In the spatial dimension, we develop a dynamic graph convolution module, employing self-attention to capture the spatial correlations in a dynamic manner. Furthermore, we explicitly model the periodicity and capture the spatial heterogeneity through embedding modules. Experiments on five real-world traffic flow datasets demonstrate that ASTGNN outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.
- **TimeMixer: Decomposable Multiscale Mixing for Time Series Forecasting**
  - *Summary*: Time series forecasting is widely used in extensive applications, such as traffic planning and weather forecasting. However, real-world time series usually present intricate temporal variations, making forecasting extremely challenging. Going beyond the mainstream paradigms of plain decomposition and multiperiodicity analysis, we analyze temporal variations in a novel view of multiscale-mixing, which is based on an intuitive but important observation that time series present distinct patterns in different sampling scales. The microscopic and the macroscopic information are reflected in fine and coarse scales respectively, and thereby complex variations can be inherently disentangled. Based on this observation, we propose TimeMixer as a fully MLP-based architecture with Past-Decomposable-Mixing (PDM) and Future-Multipredictor-Mixing (FMM) blocks to take full advantage of disentangled multiscale series in both past extraction and future prediction phases. Concretely, PDM applies the decomposition to multiscale series and further mixes the decomposed seasonal and trend components in fine-to-coarse and coarse-to-fine directions separately, which successively aggregates the microscopic seasonal and macroscopic trend information. FMM further ensembles multiple predictors to utilize complementary forecasting capabilities in multiscale observations. Consequently, TimeMixer is able to achieve consistent state-of-the-art performances in both long-term and short-term forecasting tasks with favorable run-time efficiency.
- **Scaling transformer neural networks for skillful and reliable medium-range weather forecasting**
  - *Summary*: Weather forecasting is a fundamental problem for anticipating and mitigating the impacts of climate change. Recently, data-driven approaches for weather forecasting based on deep learning have shown great promise, achieving accuracies that are competitive with operational systems. However, those methods often employ complex, customized architectures without sufficient ablation analysis, making it difficult to understand what truly contributes to their success. Here we introduce Stormer, a simple transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on weather forecasting with minimal changes to the standard transformer backbone. We identify the key components of Stormer through careful empirical analyses, including weather-specific embedding, randomized dynamics forecast, and pressure-weighted loss. At the core of Stormer is a randomized forecasting objective that trains the model to forecast the weather dynamics over varying time intervals. During inference, this allows us to produce multiple forecasts for a target lead time and combine them to obtain better forecast accuracy. On WeatherBench 2, Stormer performs competitively at short to medium-range forecasts and outperforms current methods beyond 7 days, while requiring orders-of-magnitude less training data and compute. Additionally, we demonstrate Stormer's favorable scaling properties, showing consistent improvements in forecast accuracy with increases in model size and training tokens. Code and checkpoints are available at https://github.com/tung-nd/stormer.
- **Transformer Versus LSTM: A Comparison of Deep Learning Models for Karst Spring Discharge Forecasting**
  - *Summary*: Karst springs are essential drinking water resources, however, modeling them poses challenges due to complex subsurface flow processes. Deep learning models can capture complex relationships due to their ability to learn non‐linear patterns. This study evaluates the performance of the Transformer in forecasting spring discharges for up to 4 days. We compare it to the Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Network and a common baseline model on a well‐studied Austrian karst spring (LKAS2) with an extensive hourly database. We evaluated the models for two further karst springs with diverse discharge characteristics for comparing the performances based on four metrics. In the discharge‐based scenario, the Transformer performed significantly better than the LSTM for the spring with the longest response times (9% mean difference across metrics), while it performed poorer for the spring with the shortest response time (4% difference). Moreover, the Transformer better predicted the shape of the discharge during snowmelt. Both models performed well across all lead times and springs with 0.64–0.92 for the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency and 10.8%–28.7% for the symmetric mean absolute percentage error for the LKAS2 spring. The temporal information, rainfall and electrical conductivity were the controlling input variables for the non‐discharge based scenario. The uncertainty analysis revealed that the prediction intervals are smallest in winter and autumn and highest during snowmelt. Our results thus suggest that the Transformer is a promising model to support the drinking water abstraction management, and can have advantages due to its attention mechanism particularly for longer response times.
- **Exploring transformer models for sentiment classification: A comparison of BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and XLNet**
  - *Summary*: Transfer learning models have proven superior to classical machine learning approaches in various text classification tasks, such as sentiment analysis, question answering, news categorization, and natural language inference. Recently, these models have shown exceptional results in natural language understanding (NLU). Advanced attention‐based language models like BERT and XLNet excel at handling complex tasks across diverse contexts. However, they encounter difficulties when applied to specific domains. Platforms like Facebook, characterized by continually evolving casual and sophisticated language, demand meticulous context analysis even from human users. The literature has proposed numerous solutions using statistical and machine learning techniques to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of online customer reviews, but most of them rely on various business, review, and reviewer features, which leads to generalizability issues. Furthermore, there have been very few studies investigating the effectiveness of state‐of‐the‐art pre‐trained language models for sentiment classification in reviews. Therefore, this study aims to assess the effectiveness of BERT, RoBERTa, ALBERT, DistilBERT, and XLNet in sentiment classification using the Yelp reviews dataset. The models were fine‐tuned, and the results obtained with the same hyperparameters are as follows: 98.30 for RoBERTa, 98.20 for XLNet, 97.40 for BERT, 97.20 for ALBERT, and 96.00 for DistilBERT.

## 5. 实施建议 (Implementation Suggestions)
To implement the proposed hybrid framework, consider conducting ablation studies to evaluate the contribution of each component (Mamba and Transformer) to the overall performance. Additionally, explore variations of the attention mechanism within the Transformer to enhance its ability to capture long-range dependencies. Finally, validate the framework across multiple weather datasets to ensure robustness and generalizability, potentially incorporating real-time forecasting capabilities.
